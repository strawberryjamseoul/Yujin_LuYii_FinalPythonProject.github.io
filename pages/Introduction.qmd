# Health Equity in Philadelphia: A Comprehensive Analysis

## Introduction

Health equity is a pressing concern in urban settings, where environmental and socioeconomic disparities significantly impact community well-being. In Philadelphia, these disparities are particularly pronounced, with marginalized communities facing heightened exposure to environmental hazards and limited access to resources that promote healthy living.

This report introduces the **Health Equity Index (HEI)**, a tool designed to evaluate health outcomes and identify vulnerable areas at the census tract level. By integrating environmental data (e.g., tree canopy coverage, heat vulnerability, asthma and cancer prevalence, and child blood lead levels) with socioeconomic indicators (e.g., income, education, and racial composition), the HEI provides a holistic framework to analyze health inequities in Philadelphia.

### Objectives
1. Highlight socioeconomic and demographic indicators that underscore areas at risk of health inequities.
2. Identify neighborhoods requiring prioritization for targeted public health interventions.
3. Explore the relationships between socioeconomic factors and environmental health outcomes.

The findings aim to support Philadelphiaâ€™s environmental justice goals, as outlined in local initiatives like the **Philly Tree Plan**, by providing actionable insights that inform equity-driven public health and environmental strategies. By bridging data analysis with urban policy, this research seeks to promote healthier, more equitable communities across the city.
