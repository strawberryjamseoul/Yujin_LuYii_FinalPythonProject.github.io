## Methodology

### Data Cleaning and Preparation
Each dataset underwent a standardized cleaning process to ensure compatibility and consistency:

- Verified that the **Coordinate Reference System (CRS)** matched the Philadelphia Census Tract Boundary layer and reprojected datasets as necessary.

- Conducted a **spatial join** to integrate datasets with the Census Tract Boundary layer, preserving essential columns like census tract names and GEOID.

- Created preliminary visualizations of key variables by census tract to identify spatial patterns.

### Socioeconomic and Demographic Data Processing
Additional steps were required to clean and prepare census data:

- Retrieved 2019 5-Year ACS data for Philadelphia by census tracts via an API, including over 30 columns of demographic and socioeconomic information.

- Ensured all relevant columns were numeric to enable further processing.

- Computed the following key variables:

  - **Median Household Income**
  
  - **Percentage Non-White Population**
  
  - **Percentage Dependent Population** (Ages 0-15 and 65 and older)
  
  - **Percentage of Population with Higher Education** (At least a high school diploma)
  
- Spatially joined processed census data with the Census Tract Boundary layer.

- Generated visualizations to identify potential patterns and relationships.
